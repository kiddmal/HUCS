# Project 1 - *TrunKKs Scavenger Hunt*

Submitted by: **Jamul MacNear**

**TrunKKs Scavenger Hunt** is an app that asks users to go on a scavenger hunt to capture different aspects of nature around them. This app asks the user to upload photos once a task is completed for the scavenger hunt. The photo's location data is also captured and displayed as the user uploads the photo to the platform.' [TODO] 

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays list of hard-coded tasks
- [X] When a task is tapped it navigates the user to a task detail view
- [X] When user adds photo to complete the tasks, it marks the task as complete
- [X] When adding photo of task, the location is added
- [X] User returns to home page (list of tasks) and the status of your task is updated to complete
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can launch camera to snap a picture    

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

To improve functionality, I can further research how to launch the user's camera app and also work to make the View Photo button functional.'

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges I came across while building this app included an error with the PhotoViewController not properly connecting as a swift class. After overcoming this issue, I then had the issue with the View Photo button encountering a "nil" error which I was unable to resolve. I also was not able to apply the stretch feature of launching the users camera app to take pictures.
