# Project 4 - *Outta Mind Memory Game*

Submitted by: **Jamul MacNear**

**Outta Mind Memory Game** is an app that ['features a grid of playing cards with different pictures on them to test a player's memory. The cards begin face down and a player is able to flip over two cards at a time. If the cards match, they will disappear from the screen. If the cards do not match, the cards will flip back over for the player to try another pair.'] 

Time spent: **15* hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App loads to display a grid of cards initially placed face-down:
  - Upon launching the app, a grid of cards should be visible.
  - Cards are facedown to indicate the start of the game.
- [X] Users can tap cards to toggle their display between the back and the face: 
  - Tapping on a facedown card should flip it to reveal the front.
  - Tapping a second card that is not identical should flip both back down
- [X] When two matching cards are found, they both disappear from view:
  - Implement logic to check if two tapped cards match.
  - If they match, both cards should either disappear.
  - If they don't match, they should return to the facedown position.
- [X] User can reset the game and start a new game via a button:
  - Include a button that allows users to reset the game.
  - This button should shuffle the cards and reset any game-related state.
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can select number of pairs to play with (at least 2 unique values like 2 and 4).
  * (Hint: user Picker)
- [X] App allows for user to scroll to see pairs out of view.
  * (Hint: Use a Scrollview)
- [X] Add any flavor youâ€™d like to your UI with colored buttons or backgrounds, unique cards, etc. 
  * Enhance the visual appeal of the app with colored buttons, backgrounds, or unique card designs.
  * Consider using animations or transitions to make the user experience more engaging.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I had a challenge with figuring out how to display the grid of cards using SwiftUI. I also took time to figure out how to make the cards interact with each other for matching pairs.
