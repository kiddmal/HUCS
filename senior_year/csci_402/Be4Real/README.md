# Project 2 & 3 - *Be4Real*

Submitted by: **Jamul MacNear**

**Be4Real** is an app that allows users the ability to share photos with each other featuring the photo's metadata. This app uses back4app to store data on the backend using Parse. Users are able to make an account through signinng up with their username, email, and password. Users are then able to post photos. Users cannot see one another's photos unless they themselves have posted a photo. Photo visibility expires within 24 hours which is when users must post an updated photo to their feed. Users are able to refresh their feeds. This app resembles the popular Be Real application.   [TODO]
